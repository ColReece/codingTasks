# Simple Sentiment Analysis Project

This is a project for a computer science course. 

I was tasked with creating python code that would read reviews from a supplied .csv dataset. 

The code then preprocesses the text and then analyses the sentiment of sample reviews. Finally, it compares the chosen reviews to a sample review to test the similarity function. 

The result is printed at the end in a report.

Note: Overall the results of this model are not very accurate but this task was very useful as a starting point into learning NLP. Any recommendations would be very welcome.



## Tools

This project uses:

Pandas - for working with the dataset

and

Spacy and SpacyTextBlob - for implementing NLP
## Instructions

Simply download the python file along will the provided dataset, be sure to make sure they are in the same folder, and then run the .py file.
